# Neon Postgres Vercel Marketplace Template

A minimal template for building full-stack React applications using Next.js, Vercel, and Neon.

## Getting Started

Click the "Deploy" button to clone this repo, create a new Vercel project, setup the Neon integration, and provision a new Neon database:

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fneondatabase-labs%2Fvercel-marketplace-neon%2Ftree%2Fmain&project-name=my-vercel-neon-app&repository-name=my-vercel-neon-app&products=[{%22type%22:%22integration%22,%22integrationSlug%22:%22neon%22,%22productSlug%22:%22neon%22,%22protocol%22:%22storage%22}])

Once the process is complete, you can clone the newly created GitHub repository and start making changes locally.

## Local Setup

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can use the package manager of your choice. For example, Vercel also supports `bun install` out of the box.

### Development

#### Create a .env file in the project root

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Get your database URL

Run `vercel env pull` to fetch the environment variables from your Vercel project.

Alternatively, obtain the database connection string from the Connection Details widget on the [Neon Dashboard](https://console.neon.tech/) and add it to the `.env` file:

```txt
DATABASE_URL=<postgres://user:pass@host/db>
```

#### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

#### Neon MCP Server

```
npx neonctl@latest init
```

The init command installs the Neon MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and authenticates it to Neon using a Neon API key.
